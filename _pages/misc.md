### About Me

- Thinking
  - I am living with the [`Top-Down`](https://www.daryllscott.com/discovery-vs-data) thinking mode and logic, and I always advocate problem-solving with a from-top-to-bottom viewpoint. I am INTJ.
  - I am highly sensitive to subtle details, emotions, and relationships, which makes me very meticulous about details. I am also an extremely enthusiastic organizer and have a penchant for categorizing and arranging things.
  - Whenever coming to producing or outputting, I am accustomed to a smooth, fluent, and coherent thought process. Additionally, I excel at detecting instances of cognitive leaps in others' thinking.
  Thus, I am good at bridging gaps.
  - I kinda enjoy being alone. I often do meditation. For years, I am keeping searching for my `Inner Peace`.

- Skills
  - I speak Mandarin (Native), English, Cantonese.
  - I use many programming languages (Python, Java, C/C++, HTML, etc.).
    I wrote web system (Java/Python/PHP/Node.js), Windows (C#/QT), Android (Java), iOS (Objective-C/Swift), 3D system (Unity3D), Linux&Chrome plugins (Bash/JS).
  - I always have passions for hardware programming (STM32, ARM, Arduino, Raspberry Pi), which I learned during my B.E.
  - Whenever I am not thinking about research, I will pick up my interests:
    - i) learning various natural language, e.g., French, Spanish, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean.
    - ii) making EDM music; where I have a particular fondness for genres such as Future Bass and Dubstep. 
       I use FL-Studio, Cubase and GarageBand. I exclusively follow [Vexento](https://www.youtube.com/@Vexento), [Marshmello](https://www.youtube.com/@marshmello) and [Slushii](https://www.youtube.com/@SlushiiMusic).

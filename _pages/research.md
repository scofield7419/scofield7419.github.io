# Research Statement
<div style="margin-top: 35px"></div>


### Foundation of Structure-aware Semantics Understanding

The semantics of the world can be essentially in structured formats, and different data of modalities comes with structural representations.
For example, languages have various syntactic structure definitions, e.g., dependency tree, constituency grammar and discourse structure;
and also visions can be depicted by the scene graph structures.
Besides, the world knowledge should be represented with structured format, i.e., knowledge graph; 
and also the human-level reasoning largely follows the structural manner.

</p>



Thus, the essence of semantics understanding of languages, visions, etc., lies in the understanding of the intrinsic semantic structures, which motivates my research angle.
My research has been revolving around the perspective of structure awareness modeling, which specifies the idea of **`Structure-aware Intelligence Learning` (SAIL)**, 
that enhances the semantics understanding of varied modalities with the intrinsic data structure modeling.

### High-level Research Envision

My research scope covers the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the intersection of NLP and Computer Vision (CV), i.e., Vision-Language Learning or Multimodal Machine Learning.
Starting with deep learning based semantics understanding, where I engage in structure-aware NLP and structure-aware MM,
I proactively integrate the SAIL idea into the language model (LM) for semantics understanding, i.e., structure-aware LM.
The recent rise and great triumph of LLM have reveal the great potential of leading to AGI via this path.
And the ultimate goal is thus to realize human-level AGI for universal modalities by modeling the semantic structures of the world.
To achieve the AGI goal via SAIL that aligns the most with human society, these targets also should and will be achieved, including 
efficacy, interpretability, robustness (generalizability), efficiency (scalability) and trustworthiness.
